# Nibble!

Nibble is a «Css» framework built on top of [nib](http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/).

It provides a grid system and basic elements like buttons and menu items.

It's like nibbling on on a flying spaghetti monster's tentakle.


**Lots** of credit goes to [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com). I have taken
many ideas from their lib. I'm just not that big of a SCSS fan...
